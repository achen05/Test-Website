            In the past century, design trends have been in a constant pendulum. When minimalism and its stark sterility became one of the defining aesthetics of modernism, the colorful and fun attitude of maximalism formed as a reaction of a postmodern world that was tired of minimalism. When the user interfaces of early consumer computers and smartphones were designed around skeuomorphism, a subset of maximalism, it may have come as no surprise when minimalism started to rise in popularity again as it did several decades ago. This popularity in minimalist user interfaces has been an enduring trend in the past decade with companies as large as Apple to smaller services such as Headspace having all adopted a clean, simple design in their user interfaces. It would seem this historically evident shift in design trends is long overdue and might lead one to believe that interface design will steer towards maximalism in the coming years. However, due to COVID-19 businesses have a continued, and perhaps even larger incentive to design minimalist user interfaces, as user interfaces play a large role in a business’ brand which historically favors simple and sterile branding during a pandemic. </br>
	&emsp;During a pandemic and the time that follows, businesses must adapt their branding strategies to better suit consumers who fear the ongoing virus. The circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic are no different. A study about the grocery shopping preferences amidst the COVID-19 pandemic from the Division of Applied Social Sciences at the University of Missouri concluded that</br>
&emsp;the trend in the number of new COVID-19 cases also influences grocery shopping preferences. For instance, consumers in environments where COVID-19 is spreading at an increasing rate incur the most disutility of shopping inside the store... we hypothesize that the change in consumer behavior is driven partly by feelings of fear toward the virus. (Grashuis, Skevas, Segovia)</br>
&emsp;For businesses to sustain themselves during this pandemic, they must change their branding strategies to better suit consumers who fear COVID-19. These changes tend to steer towards minimalism. According to an article posted on the International Journal of Advanced Research and Review by students and professors in the Interior Architecture Department at the Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University, throughout history, minimalism has played a fundamental role in defining the modernist aesthetic and the </br>
&emsp;wipe-clean esthetic of modernism can be partially attributed to tuberculosis. The modern architectural designs were inspired by an era of purity of form, strict geometries, modern materials, and a rejection of ornamentation. Modernist architects designed these curative environments as cleansed (physically and symbolically) from disease and pollution. (Sever, Akbulak)</br>
&emsp;The formation of minimalism is at least partially a reaction towards a fear of infection, as people wanted to feel safe from the virus. COVID-19 will undoubtedly be no different and businesses will have an incentive to steer towards more minimalist branding in order to create an image of purity and cleanliness. </br>
	&emsp;So how is user interface design relevant to COVID-19? For businesses to sustain themselves, they must not only change their brand image, but also change the way they interact with consumers in order to sell their products or services. Today, that means through the internet via user interfaces in the form of websites and apps. In their essay titled “The Role of Aesthetics in Web Design”, Lisbeth Thorlacius, a professor in the Department of Communication, Business and Information Technologies at Roskilde University argues that user interface design plays a big role in a company’s brand and how people perceive it as it’s “aesthetic effects play a crucial role in creating the profile of the sender and thus the image of the organization or individual behind the Web site. Therefore it is important that even web sites that mostly have an information purpose also aesthetically reflect the organization behind the site” (Thorlacius). User interfaces are on the forefront of how users (potential customers) perceive a business. Additionally, a business’s user interface design is also reflective of their values, which </br>
&emsp;in the postmodern society, especially today’s youth, have grown up with a large degree of wealth, among other things due to developments in digitization. This means that basic physical needs such as the needs for food and shelter are met, and when basic needs are met, there is a growing need for self-actualization and experiences in daily life… It is no longer enough to sell products based on basic facts. Products are increasingly sold on the basis of non-material values, i.e., the experiences and narratives with which they are associated. (Thorlacius) </br>
&emsp;Users need to know that the businesses they are supporting reflect their own values, which in the case of COVID-19, means that the company cares about public health and the cleanliness and safety of not only their products, but also the company’s internal processes as well. Adopting a minimalistic design philosophy for user interfaces would be advantageous for businesses both during and after the pandemic because minimalism will provide the image of organization and cleanliness that consumers want at this time. </br>
	&emsp;A possible argument against a prolonged trend in minimalist interface design in the coming years, and in favor of a new trend of maximalism is rooted in the idea that the effects of COVID-19 on the design of businesses is only temporary and will subside post-pandemic. Studies have concluded that “In environments where COVID-19 is spreading at a decreasing rate, consumer preferences for the home delivery method relative to the other methods are less strong, and the relative importance of the purchasing method attribute is lower in its entirety” (Gradhuis, Skevas, Segovia). This data may suggest that minimalism will only be used in the context of the pandemic, but will not have any lasting endurance post-pandemic. However, this suggestion is incomplete as a more probable possibility would have businesses cater to both populations that have increasing and decreasing rates of COVID-19 spread. The same study has stated that</br>
&emsp;significant differences in the grocery shopping preferences of consumers who face increasing and decreasing rates of new COVID-19 cases indicate opportunities for food retailers and deliverers to tailor business strategies to both scenarios (Gradhuis, Skevas, Segovia) <br>
&emsp;Businesses would lose many sales by only targeting an audience that is less impacted and excluding those that are significantly impacted and vice versa. Additionally, COVID-19 is very unpredictable as areas with “a decreasing rate [of COVID-19 cases] may once again experience an increasing rate in the future” (Gradhuis, Skevas, Segovia). Businesses would be wise to cater their business strategies to both audiences (affected and less affected) during the pandemic to not only capture a wider audience but also prepare for the unpredictability of COVID-19. Adopting a functional minimalist design philosophy, particularly on the digital interfaces they use to interact with customers during this pandemic, would allow them the flexibility to do exactly that. <br>
&emsp;	It would seem that maximalism will have to wait at least a few more years before it can take the spotlight once again. For the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and for some time afterwards, businesses would greatly benefit from adopting a minimalist design aesthetic to their websites, apps, and other digital interfaces used to interact with their customers. These interfaces play a big role in a business’ brand image, which during COVID-19, is important in easing customers’ fears of the virus and in building trust in a company that their products or services are clean, organized, and safe.
